# Hotel Booking Dashboard (Power BI)

This interactive Power BI report visualizes hotel booking data from Sep to Nov 2024, covering key metrics like total bookings (5K), room nights (9K), cancellations (29%), and total revenue ($1M). The dashboard includes insights into booking trends, revenue per room, weekday booking behavior, membership loyalty levels, and booking lead times. It also breaks down bookings by source and stay type (single vs. multi-night). This report helps hotel managers optimize occupancy, analyze customer behavior, and improve marketing strategies.
